# Browsers: Past, Present, and Possible Futures — Milestone #1

This folder contains an 8‑page static site that meets the project requirements:
- At least six pages with a consistent main menu
- Semantic HTML with headings, lists, **image**, and **table**
- Single CSS file with flex + grid layouts
- Demonstrates type, class, id, and attribute selectors; hover, spacing, borders, colors, and fonts

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1) Create a new public repo on GitHub named `it3203-browsers-site` (or similar).
2) Upload the files from this folder to the repo root (or commit/push from local).
3) In the repo: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
4) After it builds, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/it3203-browsers-site/`.
